* Pug - a toy programming language

The ~pug~ is an interpreter of /The Pug programming language/.\\
(that is *a toy language* for now)

The ~pug~ interpreter is also a sample application powered by /CPARSEC3/
library.

* How to build
To build the ~Pug~ interpreter, do as follows :
- *NOTE* Suppose that the leading '*$*' is a shell prompt.
- *NOTE* Suppose that the '*#*' follows words are comment.

#+begin_src shell
$ make
#+end_src

* Usage
See the help that appears by the following command.
#+begin_src shell
$ ./bin/pug --help
#+end_src

* Example
#+begin_src shell
$ ./bin/pug -e '1 + 2'
> 1 + 2
>> (Add (Num 1) (Num 2))
3

#+end_src

** Binary operators
| Operator | Example        | Explanation                         |
|----------+----------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~=~      | ~var = expr~   | assignment                          |
| ~==~     | ~expr == expr~ | equality comparison                 |
| ~!=~     | ~expr != expr~ | nonequality comparison              |
| ~<=~     | ~expr <= expr~ | less than or equal to comparison    |
| ~<~      | ~expr < expr~  | less than comparison                |
| ~>=~     | ~expr >= expr~ | greater than or equal to comparison |
| ~>~      | ~expr > expr~  | greater than comparison             |
| ~+~      | ~expr + expr~  | arithmetic addition                 |
| ~-~      | ~expr - expr~  | arithmetic subtraction              |
| ~*~      | ~expr * expr~  | arithmetic multiplication           |
| ~/~      | ~expr / expr~  | arithmetic division                 |
| ~%~      | ~expr % expr~  | arithmetic reminder                 |

** Unary operators
| Operator | Example  | Explanation            |
|----------+----------+------------------------|
| ~+~      | ~+ expr~ | (equivalent to ~expr~) |
| ~-~      | ~- expr~ | arithmetic negation    |
| ~!~      | ~! expr~ | not                    |

** Parenthesis
| Example  | Explanation              |
|----------+--------------------------|
| ~(expr)~ | parenthesized expression |

** Literal
| Example           | Explanation     |
|-------------------+-----------------|
| ~1~, ~10~, ~-100~ | decimal integer |
