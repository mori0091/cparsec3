* Pug - a toy programming language

The ~pug~ is an interpreter of /The Pug programming language/.\\
(that is *a toy language* for now)

The ~pug~ interpreter is also a sample application powered by /CPARSEC3/
library.

* How to build
To build the ~Pug~ interpreter, do as follows :
- *NOTE* Suppose that the leading '*$*' is a shell prompt.
- *NOTE* Suppose that the '*#*' follows words are comment.

#+begin_src shell
$ make
#+end_src

* Usage
See the help that appears by the following command.
#+begin_src shell
$ ./bin/pug --help
#+end_src

* Example
#+begin_src shell
$ ./bin/pug -e '1 + 2'
> 1 + 2
>> (Add 1 2)
3

#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
$ ./bin/pug -e 'let x = 1; let y = 2; x + y'
> let x = 1; let y = 2; x + y
>> (Seq (Let (Var x) 1) (Seq (Let (Var y) 2) (Add (Var x) (Var y))))
3

#+end_src

Example: fibonacci function ~fib~
#+begin_src
// `fib n` calculates `n`th fibonacci number (n>=0)
let fib = |n| {
  let f = |n a b|
    if n == 0 {
      1
    } else if n == 1 {
      a
    } else {
      f (n-1) (a+b) a
    }
  ;
  f n 1 1;
};
#+end_src
